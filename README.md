# Intro To Unix and Linux

We've had a lot of requests for an Intro to Linux type of presentation

Here's what we've come up with:

- Choosing a distribution
- Basic Unix philosophy of ‘everything is a file’
- Intro to the command line
- Scripting with Bash, Python and Perl
- Editors: getting started with Vim and Nano
- ssh and friends (sftp,scp)
- Installing packages using apt, yum, etc…
- Users and Groups
- Filesystems
- File and Directory ownership and permissions (chown,chgrp,chmod,...)
- Links and Symbolic Links
- Privilege escalation with sudo
