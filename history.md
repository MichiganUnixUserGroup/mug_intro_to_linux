## Brief History of Unix/Linux
### Late 1960s (early development):
- Multics on Mainframe AT&T Bell Labs, MIT, GE partnership
- Unused PDP-7 at AT&T Bell Labs that Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Rudd Canaday, and others started using to work on new OS
		Ken's video game initial inspiration and work done under management radar
### 1970s (initial distribution):
- Unix was named and rewritten for PDP-11
- Other AT&T Bell Labs depts purchased PDP-11 and started using Unix
- 1973 Unix introduced to public and released, but 1956 anti-trust rulling prevented selling as a product - licensed mainly to educational/academics
- 1974 first Unix user group, as AT&T Bell labs didn't support Unix. 
- 1975 version 6 released and started licensing to commercial companies
- 1978 first port to other architecture beyond PDP-11
- 1980s (commercialization and fragmentatiton):
- 1981 - licensees could sub-license for a fee
- 1983 
	- breakup of Bell System after anti-trust allowed Unix to become a commercial product. 
	- GNU (GNU's Not Unix) project founded to create an open Unix compatible OS
- 1984 - commecrial licensing became unfavorable to academic use, leading to Berkley Software Distribution (BSD).  Many Unix features landed in BSD first
- 1985 - Steve Jobs starts developing an OS (NeXTSTEP) based on Mach Kernel and items derrived from FreeBSD and other BSD releases
- 1989 - GNU GPL software (compilers, libraries, text editor, command line shell) was ready, but the kernel and device driver development had stalled.
### 1990s (Rise of Linux)
- 1991 Linux kernel project started by Linus Torvalds - A reimplementation of Unix from scratch
- 1992 386BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD) released after legal challenges
*** note: had BSD or GNU kernels been available - Linux may never have been developed
- 1995 IEEE POSIX agreed upon as a standard
- Mid-1990s first commercial linux by supercomputing centers.  Dell, HP, IBM start offering Linux as alternative to windows/Unix
### 2000 (Consolidation)
- 2001 MacOS X released based on NeXTSTEP - derrived from BSD and Mach kernel
- 2003 SCO group sues Vendors/Users of Linux
- 2005 Sun releases bulk of Solaris (Unix System V) code into OpenSolaris
- 2007/2010 Courts rule that Novell not SCO holds Unix patent. Novell declines to sue any Linux user "We do not believe there is Unix in Linux"
- 2010 Oracle Buys Sun and discontinues OpenSolaris
### Present
- Current Unix and Unix like operating systems, generally a kernel compbined with other applications make up a distribution
- Linux distributions on server, desktop, gaming, and mobile (android/ChromeOS)
- FreeBSD and other BSD distributions mainly on servers
- MacOS desktop, 2nd only to Microsoft windows
- Microsoft WSL (windows subsystem for linux) virtual machine on windows running linux
- Unix in a few locations on Mainframes or running specialized applications (cost)
